Above is the YAML definition of your section. Modify it to match your needs.

To use your section, 2 possibilities:

1. within a dropzone

Make sure that your layouts or your page includes the following liquid tag:

  {% sections_dropzone %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of any page including the {% sections_dropzone %}
(or inheriting from a layout including it):

sections_dropzone_content:
- type: "articles"
  settings:
    title: "Ullam molestiae et laboriosam."
  blocks: []


2. as stand-alone section

  {% section 'articles' %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of the page including the statement above or complete it.

sections_content:
  articles:
    settings:
      title: "Dolorem cupiditate eum harum."
    blocks: []
