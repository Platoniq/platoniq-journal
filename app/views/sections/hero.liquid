{% comment %}
Above is the YAML definition of your section. Modify it to match your needs.

To use your section, 2 possibilities:

1. within a dropzone

Make sure that your layouts or your page includes the following liquid tag:

  {% sections_dropzone %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of any page including the {% sections_dropzone %}
(or inheriting from a layout including it):

sections_dropzone_content:
- type: "hero"
  settings:
    title: "Aut eligendi error adipisci."
    subtitle: "Doloribus illum unde tempora."
    background_image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
  blocks: []


2. as stand-alone section

  {% section 'hero' %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of the page including the statement above or complete it.

sections_content:
  hero:
    settings:
      title: "Esse voluptate quia exercitationem."
      subtitle: "Deleniti sit amet ut."
      background_image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
    blocks: []
